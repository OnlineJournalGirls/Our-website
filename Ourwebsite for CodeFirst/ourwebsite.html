<P> I'm Fiona. This is the first time I've ever learned to coce using HTML and CSS. The reason I wanted to start learning to code is because everything nowadays is online. Being able to go behind the curtain and seeing the code for a wesbite is becoming a fundamental skill. I enjoy designing websites etc.
